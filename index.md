## Welcome
Welcome to the Canberra Chapter of OWASP home page!

The OWASP Canberra Chapter was active in 2013 and is being rebooted in 2020. We organise local events throughout the year.

The chapter leaders are Toby Amodio & Akshay Gupta.

## Our Goals

# Equality
We aim to bring together people from research, academia and industry to motivate, and empower others to pursue a career in cybersecurity. By raising awareness against discrimination within the workforce, we work towards increasing diversity and equality in cybersecurity.

# Education
We are committed to helping discover the next generation of cybersecurity talent. We aim to offer mentorship programs to educate those new to cybersecurity, and provide talks from industry professionals to showcase all cybersecurity has to offer.

# Community
We want to help you connect with like-minded individuals. Whether you are new to cybersecurity or a seasoned veteran, our goal is to build a community where everyone can openly discuss and explore current issues in cybersecurity, employment opportunities and more. By providing networking opportunities, we want everyone to get involved in the community and establish relationships with new people.

# Industry Insights
No cybersecurity professional would feel complete without latest Industry insights and we will aim to hold various Industry leaders led sessions/talks from time to time.

# Chapter Rules and Policies
